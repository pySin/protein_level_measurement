# Protein Level Measurement

## Introduction
Analyse data from protein levels in the nuclear fraction of cerebral cortex in mice. The data is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/mice-protein-expression. The experiment uses different strategies to assess associative learning explained in the link provided. 

## Tasks

1 Compare the levels of every protein when the mice are injected with mematine or with saline solution.

## Technologies used:

* MySQL
* Python - mysql.connector, re

## Setup

1. Download the Data_Cortex_Nuclear.csv file from https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/mice-protein-expression
