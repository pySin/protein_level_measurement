Find a natural learner

In the protein data (https://www.kaggle.com/ruslankl/mice-protein-expression) table we  have protein levels divided by class.
One of the classes is called 'stimulated to learn'. The average protein levels for the stimulated to learn mouse will be compared
with the average protein levels for every normal mouse. The mouse which has protein levels closest to the stimulated to learn
levels is our natural learner.
